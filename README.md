# Word Wrap

> This project is a solution for the [word wrap kata](https://codingdojo.org/kata/WordWrap/). The model class, Wrapper contains only one static function named wrap which accepts two arguments, a string, and a column number. The function returns the string, but with line breaks inserted at just the right places to ensure that no line exceeds the column number. Lines are broken at word boundaries and like a word processor, the line is broken by replacing the last space in a line with a newline.
